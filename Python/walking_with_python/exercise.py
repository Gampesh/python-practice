1). Declare a variable and convert the same variable to differnet data types and check its mutability along with the data type

2). Using if else clause print 'I am a string' if the defined variable is a strin or else 'i am an integer' if its an integer.2

3). Check the reference count of 2 lists, dictionaries and then check it again after adding some elements in it.

4). Find out the first and last element of a list.

5). print a list such that it contains all the elements of list a and b.
a = [1,2,3,4] b = [5,6,7,8]


6). Convert a list to a set and then check the memory address of the set.

7). remove the last element of the list

8). Perform sorting of the list a=[9,8,1,3,4,7,6,5,2].

9). make a list of dictionaries {1:1, 2:2}, {'1':1, 3:3, 4:4}, {1.1:10, 5:5, 6:6} and print the value of 1 of first dictionary and value of '1' of second dict.

10). make a list of tuples and print each tuple with and without list comprehension.

11). Print the square of each element in the list a=[1,2,3,4] with and without using list comprehension

12). Print only the odd numbers in the list with and without list comprehension

13). change 2 lists, dictionary values using shallow copy and deep copy.

14). print all even numbers except the frst and last one in a list with and without list comprehension.

15). check if the value 15 is available in the list a=[1,2,15] using different ways.

16). Print all the numbers in the list greater than the first 3 elements of the list [1,10,20, 2,3,50,40,10,9,60,70,90] using different ways.

17). try to use same keys in a dictionary

18). Create a separate dictionary b same as a={1:1, 2:2, 3:3} using for loop

19). Create a dictionary with keys 1-50 and a value '100'. Hint: fromkeys()

20). Create a dictionary with keys 1-50 and its values as the hash of the keys

21). Convert the list [1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,7,8,0] to a set

22). Try to see the first element of the set an also hash the whole set

23). Add some elements to an existing set and pop the elements out

24). Use Frozenset and check its hash and try to add or pop elements from it.

25). Convert the list [1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,7,8,0] to a tuple

26). Try to see the first element of the tuple an also hash the whole tuple as well as particular elements from it
